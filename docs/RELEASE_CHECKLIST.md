# Release checklist

Run before store submission or a major production deploy.

**Step-by-step production setup:** see [DEPLOY_OPS.md](./DEPLOY_OPS.md) (Supabase migration order, Render env, secret audit, Flutter `API_BASE`).

## Environment (engine host, e.g. Render)

- [ ] `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY` (or anon), `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_MODEL`
- [ ] `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` set if you ship **Flutter web**; leave empty for mobile-only (`*` + no credentials)
- [ ] `ADMIN_API_KEY` set if you use `GET /api/admin/stats` (call with header `X-Admin-Key`)
- [ ] `DOWNLOAD_PACK_BACKFILL_DEFAULT` — leave `false` unless you accept extra latency/cost on pack downloads

## Supabase (production)

- [ ] Apply SQL migrations in order: `001_schema.sql` → `007_subject_display_rank.sql`

## Secrets

- [ ] `.env` never committed (`engine/.gitignore` ignores it)
- [ ] Rotate `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` and `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY` if there was any leak risk

## Flutter production build

- [ ] `flutter build … --dart-define=API_BASE=https://your-engine.example.com` (no trailing slash)

## QA (manual)

| Flow | Check |
|------|--------|
| National download | Download one subject → topics + pack; row shows ready for offline practice |
| WAEC/NECO | Single subject selected → configure → instructions → offline session (~40 questions); try year/difficulty/topic |
| JAMB | Up to 4 selected → multi-config → practice **tabs**; ~40 questions per subject |
| Sparse pack | With backfill off, empty filter shows clear messaging |
| School | POST UTME / JUPEB → institution → subject → config → **network** session works |
| AI tutor | In offline national practice, open **AI tutor** sheet; question sends to `POST /api/tutor/chat` (needs internet) |
| Weak topics | Miss a question offline → Drawer **Weak topics practice** lists subject → session from saved topics |

## Store copy (honest scope)

- **National (JAMB, WAEC, NECO):** offline topics and offline practice from downloaded question packs; JAMB supports multiple subjects with tabs.
- **POST UTME / JUPEB:** requires connection; not the same offline pack flow as national.
